Detailed Financial Analysis


Income Statement

Tax Effect of Unusual Items: This metric reflects the impact of non-recurring items, such as one-time gains or losses, on the company’s tax obligations. These items can distort the true profitability of the company, so adjusting for them helps provide a clearer view of ongoing operational performance.

Normalized EBITDA: This represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for unusual or non-recurring items. It offers a better understanding of the company's core operational performance by excluding impacts from extraordinary events or accounting adjustments.

Balance Sheet

Ordinary Shares Number: This figure shows the total number of common shares outstanding. It’s crucial for calculating metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and understanding the company's equity distribution.

Net Debt: Calculated as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents. It provides insight into the company’s overall leverage by showing the amount of debt the company would have if it used its available cash to pay down some of its debt.

Cash Flow Statement

Free Cash Flow: This is the cash available after accounting for capital expenditures. It indicates the amount of cash a company generates from its operations that can be used for paying dividends, repurchasing stock, or reinvesting in the business. It’s calculated as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures.

Repurchase of Capital Stock: This represents the cash outflow related to buying back shares from the market. It’s an indicator of how the company is using its cash, often to return value to shareholders or manage its capital structure.

Graph Analysis

Revenue and Profit Trends: The graph shows Starbucks’ revenue and net income from 2020 to 2023. Revenue demonstrates a consistent increase, reflecting the company’s ability to grow its top line. However, net income fluctuates, which suggests that while revenue is growing, profitability is inconsistent. This could be due to varying costs, expenses, or other factors impacting profit margins.
Expense Analysis

Interest Expenses: Interest expenses grew from $437 million in 2020 to $550 million in 2023. This increase may indicate a rise in the company’s debt levels or higher interest rates on existing debt, impacting profitability.

General and Administrative Expenses: These expenses increased from $1.68 billion in 2020 to $2.44 billion in 2023. This rise may reflect higher costs associated with operating and managing the business, such as salaries, rent, and administrative overhead.

Rent Expenses: Rent expenses rose from $2.39 billion in 2020 to $2.87 billion in 2023. This increase may be due to expanding store locations or higher rental rates, impacting the company’s operational costs.

Financial Metrics

P/E Ratio Calculation: The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the trailing twelve months’ earnings per share (EPS). This ratio helps assess the stock’s valuation, indicating how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings. A high P/E ratio may suggest that the stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates in the future.
